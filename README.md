# SPACE_X_PROJECT

## Goal 
Use Data Science to predict if the SPACEX Falcon Rocket will land successfully
  
## <u>Context</u>
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if you can accurately predict the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, you can determine the cost of a launch
